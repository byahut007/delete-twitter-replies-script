# Twitter/X Replies Deletion Script

## Overview

This repository contains a JavaScript automation script called `deleteMyRepliesWithDebug.js` that helps users automatically delete their replies from Twitter/X. The script provides an async function `deleteMyRepliesWithDebug(n, myUsername)` that can identify and delete up to a specified number of replies from your Twitter/X account.

## What the Script Does

The script automates the process of finding and deleting your replies on Twitter/X by:

- **Automated Reply Detection**: Scans the current page to identify replies posted by the specified username
- **Batch Deletion**: Deletes up to the specified number of replies (parameter `n`) 
- **Smart Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls the page to load additional replies when needed
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where delete buttons or confirmation dialogs are not found
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Provides detailed console output for monitoring and debugging
